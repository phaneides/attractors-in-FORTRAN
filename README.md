# Interesting Attractors Solving with numerical methods written in Fortran.

All the attractors are systems of first order differential equations for 
each of the coordinates variables x, y, z. 

the vector (dx, dy, dz) that encodes the system (the attractor) is 
passed to a generic ODE solver written in fortran.

The results are stored in a `.dat` file and this file can be plotted in any program build for that,
in this repo we use VisPy by its speed and simplicity.
